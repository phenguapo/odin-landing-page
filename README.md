# odin-landing-page
assignment by theodinproject

A landing page for my music project, made using only html and css. Fun project which helped me understand css animations and flexboxes a bit better. Will possibly come back in the future to add javascript.

given inspiration for the project: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
